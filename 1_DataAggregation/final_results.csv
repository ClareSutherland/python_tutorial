EXP2part1,A little frustrated as I was concentrating on the simulation.,Went over again and again in my head what I needed to do once I returned to the simulation.
EXP2part2,"Not much different, I anticipated that there would be more tasks to do in the filled distraction though.",I made a mental note of where the conflict in the main page was and tried to keep repeating which key to press for the departing plane
EXP2part3,Knew there would be collisions happening but couldn't do anything. Felt like I needed to prepare.,Moved the mouse toward the expected collisions. Thought of what key to press for the special hand offs.
EXP2part4,Interruption is not necessary because It does not stops collision.,I just relaxed my eyes when interrupted by blank screen.
EXP2part5,"Annoyed, it distracted me from the game.",Remembered where the trouble was so I could fix it straight away when the interruption ended.
EXP2part6,Felt a pressure to remember the incomplete tasks from the primary stimulation.,Tried to remember the incomplete tasks by saying them in my head
